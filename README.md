### Reflection

**Situation**  
During the Career Counselling module, I found myself uncertain about my professional path in the long run. I struggled with identifying clear career goals. While I had general interests, I lacked direction and a structured way to transform those into actionable plans.

**Task**  
My task was to complete self-assessment tools to identify my core values, ideal workplace environment, and long-term aspirations. I needed to lay out specific, achievable goals based on this information.

**Action**  
A few worksheets and assessments were done, including the SMART goal-setting framework. I took a look at past experiences to understand what motivated me most and researched industries aligned with my values like integrity, honesty, and responsibility. I set one main career goal which highlighted that by June next year I would have completed at least two certifications, one in cybersecurity and one in data analytics.

**Result**  
I now have a career development plan that paves the way for my future. The process gave me confidence and clarity about the types of roles and environments where I’ll thrive. I can articulate my goals and take focused steps toward achieving them. I now understand the value of setting clear goals and holding myself accountable.

## Section 2: Skills and Interests

### Reflection

**Situation**  
I often underestimated my soft skills and found it hard to recognize how they applied in professional settings. I thought of real skills only in the sense of academics or past part-time work experiences. I wanted to better understand how to present them effectively.

**Task**  
I needed to identify my top skills and provide real-life examples of when and how I used them successfully.

**Action**  
I completed the Skills & Interests Quiz, which helped categorize my interests into three main areas: Artistic, Investigative, and Realistic. I then reflected on university group projects and part-time jobs to find concrete examples such as when I was responsible for UI design, making me realize that innovation and creativity are one of my top scoring interests.

**Result**  
I now confidently articulate my strengths in interviews and CVs. I’ve learned that soft skills are just as highly important like technical skills, and being able to explain how I’ve used them gives me a competitive edge. I have a better understanding of why I enjoy the things I do and this deeper self-awareness will help me venture into a career that satisfies me.

## Section 3: Personality Assessment

### Reflection

**Situation**  
I’ve always known that I was a creative and people-oriented person, but I didn’t think my personality would play that much of a role in job satisfaction. There have been times where I felt misunderstood, and sometimes drained, and it is now that I realize that the reason for that might’ve just been a personality and job mismatch.

**Task**  
I needed to interpret how my personality aligns with the work I want to do and the environments I want to work in. I needed to figure out which spaces energized me and which left me frustrated and uninterested.

**Action**  
I completed the Personality Assessment Quiz. I also engaged in a deeper personality evaluation that asked insightful questions such as “Where do you get your energy?”, “How do you make your decisions?”, and more. These prompted me to reflect on my behaviors and preferences.

**Result**  
The personality assessments helped me appreciate my natural tendencies and how to take advantage of them. I’m now more self-aware in group settings and understand how to communicate better with different personality types. I know what work environments suit me and how to express that in interviews and applications.

### Reflection

**Situation**  
Initially, my CV was basic and did not properly reflect my achievements, skills, or potential. It was overwhelming, filled with unnecessary details, and didn’t follow the best structure. This made me realize it wasn’t strong enough to stand out to employers.

**Task**  
I needed to create a compelling CV that highlighted my achievements, education, skills, and experiences in a way that was clear, professional, and appealing to potential employers.

**Action**  
I followed the step-by-step CV guide provided in the training. I restructured my CV into defined sections: personal summary, education, technical skills, work experience, and achievements. I made sure the content followed proper formatting rules, used bullet points, and added relevant accomplishments. I proofread it multiple times and asked for feedback before finalizing.

**Result**  
The final CV looks clean, professional, and acts as a strong marketing tool for my skills. I feel confident submitting it and now know how to customize it for different opportunities. I finally feel like it will start grabbing the attention of the right people.

## Section 5: CV Submission

### Reflection

**Situation**  
Submitting my CV felt like the final outcome of all the work I had done and the knowledge gained throughout the training. I wanted to ensure it made a strong and lasting impression.

**Task**  
My objective was to submit a complete and professional job application that highlighted my skills, experiences, and showed alignment with the role I was applying for.

**Action**  
I carefully reviewed the job description and made adjustments to both my CV and cover letter to match the employer’s requirements. I double-checked for spelling and formatting errors and ensured everything was consistent. I then submitted my application through the requested channel.

**Result**  
I submitted the final CV with confidence. I felt fulfilled knowing that it represented me in the best possible way. The experience reminded me how important it is to pay attention to detail and take pride in my work. It gave me a strong sense of accomplishment and encouraged me to apply for more positions in the future.

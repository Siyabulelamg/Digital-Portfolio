### Reflection

**Situation**  
During the Career Counselling module, I found myself uncertain about my professional path in the long run. I struggled with identifying clear career goals. While I had general interests, I lacked direction and a structured way to transform those into actionable plans.

**Task**  
My task was to complete self-assessment tools to identify my core values, ideal workplace environment, and long-term aspirations. I needed to lay out specific, achievable goals based on this information.

**Action**  
A few worksheets and assessments were done, including the SMART goal-setting framework. I took a look at past experiences to understand what motivated me most and researched industries aligned with my values like integrity, honesty, and responsibility. I set one main career goal which highlighted that by June next year I would have completed at least two certifications, one in cybersecurity and one in data analytics.

**Result**  
I now have a career development plan that paves the way for my future. The process gave me confidence and clarity about the types of roles and environments where Iâ€™ll thrive. I can articulate my goals and take focused steps toward achieving them. I now understand the value of setting clear goals and holding myself accountable.

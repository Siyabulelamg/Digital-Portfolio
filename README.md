### Reflection

**Situation**  
During the Career Counselling module, I found myself uncertain about my professional path in the long run. I struggled with identifying clear career goals. While I had general interests, I lacked direction and a structured way to transform those into actionable plans.

**Task**  
My task was to complete self-assessment tools to identify my core values, ideal workplace environment, and long-term aspirations. I needed to lay out specific achievable goals.

**Action**  
A few worksheets and assessments were done, including the SMART goal-setting framework. I took a look at past experiences to understand what motivated me most and researched industries that aligned with my values like integrity, honesty, and responsibility. I set one main career goal which highlighted that by June next year I would have completed at least two certifications, one in cybersecurity and one in data analytics.

**Result**  
I now have a career development plan that paves the way for my future. The process gave me confidence and clarity about the types of roles and environments where I’ll succeed. I can articulate my goals and take focused steps toward achieving them. I now understand the value of setting clear goals and holding myself accountable.

## Section 2: Skills and Interests

###  [Skills and Interests](./skills-and-interests.pdf)

---

### Reflection

**Situation**  
I often underestimated my soft skills and found it hard to recognize how they applied in professional settings. I thought of real skills only in the sense of academics or past part-time work experiences. I wanted to better understand how to present them effectively.

**Task**  
I needed to identify my top skills and provide real-life examples of when and how I used them successfully.

**Action**  
I completed the Skills & Interests Quiz, which helped categorize my interests into three main areas: Artistic, Investigative, and Realistic. I then reflected on university group projects and part-time jobs to find concrete examples such as when I was responsible for UI design, making me realize that innovation and creativity are one of my top scoring interests.

**Result**  
I now confidently articulate my strengths in interviews and CVs. I’ve learned that soft skills are just as highly important as technical skills. I have a better understanding of why I enjoy the things I do and this deeper self-awareness will help me venture into a career that satisfies me.

## Section 3: Personality Assessment

### Reflection

**Situation**  
I’ve always known that I was a creative and people-oriented person, but I didn’t think my personality would play that much of a role in job satisfaction. There have been times where I felt misunderstood and sometimes drained, and it is now that I realize that the reason for that might’ve just been a personality and job mismatch.

**Task**  
I needed to interpret how my personality aligns with the work I want to do and the environments I want to work in. I needed to figure out which spaces energized me and which left me frustrated and uninterested.

**Action**  
I completed the Personality Assessment Quiz. I also engaged in a deeper personality evaluation that asked insightful questions such as “Where do you get your energy?”, “How do you make your decisions?”, and more. These prompted me to reflect on my behaviors and preferences.

**Result**  
The personality assessments helped me appreciate my natural tendencies and how to take advantage of them. I’m now more self-aware in group settings and understand how to communicate better with different personality types. I know what work environments suit me and how to express that in interviews and applications.

### Reflection

**Situation**  
Before this, I had made a professional CV, however, I was unsure about whether it was what potential employers were looking for since I had not been getting the vocational work I had applied for.

**Task**  
I needed to create a compelling CV that represents me well by understanding the necessary sections and structure required.

**Action**  
I attended the class based on CV creation, studied the module notes, and used the checklist to build my own CV. I tried my best to get it to meet a high standard.

**Result**  
I produced a well-structured, professional CV that highlights my education, technical and soft skills, and achievements. Because I know I have followed the correct formatting, I am confident that my next application will be a success.

## Section 5: CV Submission

### [CV Submission](./cv-submission.pdf)

### Reflection

**Situation**  
Initially, my CV was basic and did not properly reflect my achievements, skills, or potential. It was overwhelming, filled with unnecessary details, and didn’t follow the best structure. This made me realize it wasn’t strong enough to stand out to employers.

**Task**  
My objective was to take note of what I had learned and apply it when creating my CV. I needed to create a compelling CV that highlighted my achievements, education, skills, and experiences in a way that was clear, professional, and appealing to potential employers.

**Action**  
I carefully went through the checklist provided, ticking items I already had and adding those I didn't. I restructured my CV into defined sections: personal summary, education, technical skills, work experience, and achievements. I made sure the content followed proper formatting rules, used bullet points, and added relevant accomplishments. I proofread it multiple times and asked for feedback before finalizing it.

**Result**  
The final CV looks clean, and professional, and acts as a strong marketing tool for my skills. I feel confident submitting it and now know how to customize it for different opportunities. I finally feel like it will start grabbing the attention of the right people.
